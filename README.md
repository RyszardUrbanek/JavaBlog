# JavaBlog
My first bigger project and repository. A typical blog-like website with basic blog functionalities, such as user registration, adding posts, rating uploaded posts, user panel, where you can view your account's data and statistics (liked, disliked posts) and few others. It was wrote using Java, Jakarta EE, HTML and CSS, relational database (MySql), some JS and implementing design patterns (DAO, DTO and service layer classes).
